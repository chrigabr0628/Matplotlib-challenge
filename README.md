# Pymaceuticals-challenge

Analysis:


Extraction, Loading, and Transformation:

Set up dependencies. Created new directory path. Loaded in csv files. Merged datasets into one single data frame. Calculated mouse count and number of duplicate mouse ID. Cleaned data by removing duplicated mouse ID. Created a summary table pf the cleaned/merged data. Created graphs and charts to visualize the data.



Outcome:

There were more male mice than female mice. Larger mice appear to have had the largest tumor volume. According to the box plot, the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane appear to have had the greatest positive effect on tumor volume as they both had the lowest, final tumor volume. Ramicane appears to have had a slightly greater effect. Initially, the drug Capomulin appears to have increased the tumor volume, significantly decreased the tumor volume around 20 days, raised the tumor volume again around 25 days, so on and so forth. It appears the Capomulin drug was volatile. The drug Propriva appears to have had the least positive effect on tumor volume.
